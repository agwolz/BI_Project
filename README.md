###Active time log:

####04/19 13:30 - 13:50
setup, examining data files, establishing some workflow

this will be useful in case I close the google doc while working on it, or keeping it open while not.

###Thought process and insights:
####Data Structure
* user_status.csv
* user-n
    * device-n
        * collated_call_log.txt
        * collated_contact_list.txt
        * collated_sms_log.txt
        
-contact names are idiosyncratic. phone number is primary ID marker
